The sequence of repeating numbers (quantity of which is not more than the number of page frames) would give bigger hit/miss ratio.
The reason for that is there simply wouldn't be any misses except the ones at the first reference.
In our case, to increase the ratio we can just put all repeating pages one after another, so that they would be present in the page frames.

In contrast, the sequence of absolutely different numbers (that do not repeat) would give miss every time.
Hence, the sequence would give smaller hit/miss ratio.
In our case, to decrease the ratio we can put repeating pages at least 10 pages away from each other and possibly not in the positions 10 to n (where n is the number of page frames).
10 to n, because these positions are modified less than the others, but we want them to be changed before the hit.
