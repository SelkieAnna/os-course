The sequence of repeating numbers (quantity of which is not more than the number of page frames) would give bigger hit/miss ratio.
The reason for that is there simply wouldn't be any misses except the ones at the first reference.

In contrast, the sequence of absolutely different numbers (that do not repeat) would give miss every time.
Hence, the sequence would give smaller hit/miss ratio.
